# HTML-PHP-Contact-Form
This is a contact form for a HTML website made from HTML, CSS and PHP. Easily designed to 'plug and play with minimal effort'.

### Implementing the HTML

To start you will need to have an existing contact page that you are going to have on your website. Take the HTML code from this project and simply copy and paste it into the body of the code on your contact page.

### Implementing the CSS

CSS is not essential for this contact form though it obviously looks and works a lot better when CSS is included. The CSS file that is included on this page will style the form in a simplistic but nice manner and also in the centre of its' parent div.

This CSS can be copied and pasted into your inline or external CSS document and then can be changed to fit your sites style.

### Using the PHP code

Save the PHP code in a new file named 'contactengine.php'. If you wish to change the name of this file, ensure that you also change the action attribute to contain the new name of the document.

After saving the PHP document you can then change the email at the top of the page to your own and then also change the message you want sending to you and the website user.
